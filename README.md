# 📰 News Reader App

## Project Overview

The News Reader App is a frontend web application built with React that allows users to browse, search, and read the latest news articles from a public news API. The app fetches real-time news data and presents it in a clean, responsive, and user-friendly interface.

This project simulates a real-world frontend development workflow and focuses on consuming APIs, managing application state, building reusable components, and creating responsive layouts.

The primary API source used for this project is the 'Currents News API' (https://currentsapi.services/en)
